# SIH25021 – Problem Statement

## Background
Indian Railways procures track fittings such as elastic rail clips, rail pads,
liners, and sleepers in very large quantities every year.
Currently, there is no permanent and unique identification mechanism to track
these components throughout their lifecycle.

## Problem
Due to the absence of a unified identification system:
- Vendor and batch traceability is limited
- Warranty and inspection records are difficult to monitor
- Performance assessment during service life is challenging
- Inventory and maintenance planning becomes inefficient

## Requirement
The system must:
- Provide permanent and durable identification
- Be readable using mobile devices
- Survive harsh railway operating conditions
- Integrate with existing Indian Railways digital systems
