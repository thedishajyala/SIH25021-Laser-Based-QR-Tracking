# SIH25021 – Laser-Based QR Code Marking System for Indian Railways

Smart India Hackathon 2025 | Laser-based QR code marking &amp; AI-enabled tracking for Indian Railways

## 📌 Problem Statement

Indian Railways procures track fittings such as elastic rail clips, rail pads, liners, and sleepers
in very large quantities every year. Currently, there is no permanent and unique identification
mechanism to track these components throughout their lifecycle.

This lack of traceability affects:
- Quality control and inspections
- Warranty and batch tracking
- Performance monitoring during service life
- Inventory and maintenance planning

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a **laser-based QR code marking system** integrated with **AI-driven analytics**
that enables unique identification, lifecycle tracking, and quality monitoring of railway track
fittings under real-world operating conditions.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed solution uses **laser-etched QR codes** permanently marked on track fittings.
Each QR code represents a unique identifier linked to a centralized backend system.

- Field personnel can scan the QR code using a mobile device
- Manufacturing, inspection, and maintenance data is retrieved instantly
- AI modules analyze historical data to detect anomalies and performance issues
- The system integrates with existing Indian Railways platforms such as UDM and TMS
