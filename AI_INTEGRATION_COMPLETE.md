# ✅ AI Alert System Integration Complete

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

The AI Alert System has been **successfully integrated** into your QR Manufacturing System! You now have a single-command deployment that includes all the AI intelligence features you requested.

## 🚀 Single Command Deployment

```bash
./run_services.sh
```

This one command now runs your **complete system** including:
- Combined Backend Service (Port 5002) with integrated AI alerts
- Engraving Service (Port 8004)
- Full AI predictive analytics and alert management

## 🧠 AI Features Now Live

### ✅ Integrated AI Alert Endpoints
- `http://localhost:5002/ai-alerts/generate` - Generate alerts for UID
- `http://localhost:5002/ai-alerts/list` - View all alerts
- `http://localhost:5002/ai-alerts/summary` - Alert statistics
- `http://localhost:5002/ai-alerts/{id}/acknowledge` - Acknowledge alerts
- `http://localhost:5002/ai-alerts/{id}/resolve` - Resolve alerts

### ✅ Machine Learning Algorithms Active
- **Random Forest** - For predictive component failure analysis
- **Isolation Forest** - For anomaly detection in railway components
- **Priority Classification** - 5-level system (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)

### ✅ Alert Types Operational
1. **Expiry Warnings** - Component lifecycle alerts
2. **Safety Alerts** - Critical safety notifications
3. **Maintenance Alerts** - Predictive maintenance scheduling
4. **Inventory Alerts** - Stock level monitoring
5. **Compliance Alerts** - Regulatory compliance tracking
6. **Performance Alerts** - System performance monitoring
